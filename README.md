# Typing Speed Test (Flask app)

This is a Typing Speed Test web application implemented using Flask, HTML, and CSS.

# Overview
The Flask Typing Speed Test allows users to measure their typing speed by typing a given passage within a specified time duration. Users can select the duration of the test (30 seconds, 1 minute, or 2 minutes) and then start typing the displayed passage. Once the time is up, the accuracy and words per minute (WPM) are calculated and displayed to the user.

# Features
Users can select the duration of the typing test (30 seconds, 1 minute, or 2 minutes).
Random passages are generated for each test from a predefined list of sentences.
Accuracy and WPM are calculated and displayed to the user after completing the test.
Users can reset the test and start a new one.
